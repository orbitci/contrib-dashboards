## CI Providers

- [GitHub](./github)

## Import Instructions

- Open the relevant JSON file in this repository and copy its contents.
- In Datadog, create a new dashboard or open the existing Orbit CI sample dashboard.
- Paste the copied contents using **Ctrl+V**.
- Datadog will ask for confirmation before applying the changes.

> **Important:**
> Pasting will overwrite the current dashboard layout.
> To avoid losing any existing widgets or configurations, we recommend maintaining a
> separate dashboard, pasting the copied contents there, and then selectively copying
> over specific widgets to your main dashboard as needed.
